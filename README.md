I made these projects in my first two years of learning object oriented programming in Java. The first project is simply a graphing calculator. 
As it stands it just graphs linear and quadratic equations, I found it hard at the time to extract a string of an equation and read which numbers were coefficients
and which were powers and of course
the variables. Found it easier though to read the constants a, b, c from the quadratic and from there make two arrays of x and y resulting from a, b and c.
I hope to add on to this 
in my break when I'm done with my engineering exams probably in December.

The second project of the planets was more friendly. I found it easier to make the planets move around in a circle using polar equations and coordinates
instead of rectangular coordinates. But of course we know from Kepler's that planets move in elliptical orbits and the paths I traced for my planets were
perfect circles instead of ellipses. I could try to work on this too this December, we could exggerate the eccentricities a bit to make them look near elliptical
And of course we didn't ever forget to give Uranus a clockwise rotation. What could be cool though is to make 3 dimensional versions of these projects
I don't know how to do that and I think that's why it's going to be more interesting if I try
